        <h2>Stuff About Me</h2>
        <p>Designer at heart, everything else for work.</p>
        <p>Iâ€™ve been working on various web things since I was 15 years old - but wait, don't think it's too impressive yet, I'm only currenlty 20 years old.</p>
        <p>I also do things like read and practice a bit of photograghy in my free time. I decided to also pick this course up since I need to learn more but am not a fan of college (at all).</p>

        <h2>What I want to do</h2>

        <ul class="skills">
          <li>I Kinda</li>
          <li>Want</li>
          <li>To do</li>
          <li>More</li>
          <li>Development</li>
        </ul>
        <p>So becasue of that, I decided to enroll in this course. I want to be able to create the crazy designs I think of in my head! Instead of paying someone else or using things like WordPress to get around a few things here and there.</p>
